# Rock, Paper, Scissors – JavaScript Game

This is a simple browser-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using vanilla JavaScript and HTML.  
The aim of this project was to practice core JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

## Project Overview

The game allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.  
Each round compares the player’s choice with a randomly generated computer choice, updates the score, and displays the result on screen. The game ends when either the player or the computer reaches five points.

## How It Works

1. The user clicks one of the buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors  
2. The computer randomly selects a move  
3. The round winner is determined using conditional logic  
4. Scores are updated and displayed in the browser  
5. Once a score of five is reached, the game ends and further input is disabled  

All UI updates are handled dynamically through JavaScript.
